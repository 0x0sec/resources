#MD5 Hashing

MD5 is a [widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32 digit hexadecimal number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).  Commonly this system is used to check that a download is uncorrupted, as the algorithm represents a large amount of text or information in a short string of numbers. It is also used as security to check that files are not tampered with, as any slight change in data causes extremely different md5 hashes.
