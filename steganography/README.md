#Steganography

Steganography [is the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), and in the context of CTFs usually means finding the hints and flags that have been hidden with steganography.  Most commonly a picture or image file will be given as a task with no further instructions, and the participants have to be able to uncover the message that has been encoded in the media.
